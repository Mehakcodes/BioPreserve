# DApp for Biodiversity Conservation and Cultural Heritage Preservation

![Project Banner](path_to_your_image/banner.jpg)

## Overview
Our solution is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to support biodiversity conservation and cultural heritage preservation. This platform leverages blockchain technology to provide a transparent, secure, and engaging way for users to contribute directly to biodiversity conservation efforts and cultural heritage sites projects. By eliminating traditional crowdfunding inefficiencies and trust issues, we empower users to make a real impact. Additionally, a dynamic calendar lists upcoming biodiversity events, allowing users to stay informed and participate actively. In return for their contributions, users receive tokens that can be redeemed for various rewards within the platform's ecosystem, incentivizing continued engagement and support.

## Key Features
- **Transparent Fund Management**: Blockchain ensures secure, immutable transaction records, providing full transparency of fund flow.
- **Project Listings and Direct Support**: Users can explore detailed information on various conservation projects, including their goals, progress, and impact metrics, and directly support them without intermediaries.
- **Contribution Mechanism**: Allows users to seamlessly donate funds to selected projects.
- **Transparent Tracking**: Contributions and project funding status are transparently tracked on the blockchain.
- **Token Rewards**: Contributors receive tokens for their donations, which can be exchanged for rewards within and outside the platform's ecosystem.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: External APIs provide real-time updates on project status and achievements.
- **Smart Contracts**: Ensure funds are only released when predefined conditions are met, increasing trust and accountability.
- **Event Calendar**: A dynamic calendar of upcoming biodiversity events, such as clean-up drives, tree-planting sessions, wildlife monitoring, and educational workshops. Events can be filtered by location, type, and date for easy navigation.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain Integration**:
  - Implements blockchain smart contracts for managing contributions and project funding securely.
  - Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for transparency and immutability of transactions.
  - Deploys smart contracts on Ethereum testnets (e.g., Sepolia) for development and testing, ensuring secure and reliable contract functionality.
  - Used Etherium, MetaMask, Truffle, Ganache 
- **Frontend**:
  - Employs React.js and tailwind CSS for the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.
  - Integrates with Web3.js or Ethers.js to facilitate interaction between the frontend and the Ethereum blockchain.
  - Used ReactJs and Tailwind Css
- **Backend**:
  - Powered by Node.js for efficient server-side logic and handling of data.
  - Utilizes Express.js to create RESTful APIs for managing user data, project listings, and transaction records.
  - Used Express Jsand Node Js
- **Smart Contract Development**:
  - Uses Truffle suite for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
  - Employs Ganache for local blockchain testing and migration of smart contracts during the development phase.
